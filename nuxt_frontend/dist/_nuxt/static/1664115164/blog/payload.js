Many of us don't at all. Many of us have gone on to do different things, set different priorities in life.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor many of us, the spark of Minecraft is gone - for the moment. That's why TxT and I have made the difficult decision to close down the Minecraft server. Not now, not instantly - but on \u003Cb\u003ESeptember 23rd\u003C\u002Fb\u003E of this year. That is exactly 3 years after the last launch of the Paxterya project.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe History of Paxterya\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn September 23, 2019, we started Paxterya Beta, now called Season 2, for simplicity's sake. The past 3 years have been great (except the whole world crises stuff - strictly speaking about Minecraft here).\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn Season 2, we were so few Paxteryans. Among the rare members before the third Season in December 2019 were Veik, Sprouse and Aki. All of which are on the staff team today and have put so much time and passion into the maintenance of this community. Thanks to you and the other staff May, Lola, MrCarMan, swab, shrum and Flamme, this whole undertaking was even possible. TxT and I wouldn't have managed to keep Paxterya a friendly place without you.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHave you noticed I just spoke about Season 2 being the start in 2019? What about Season 1? That one started on June 4, 2017 and was shut down a few months later. It took a full two years before TxT and I sat in the school cafeteria making plans for a Minecraft server again. So you never know what might happen, like it always is in life.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EAn Outlook on the Future\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe truth is, for most of you, this announcement won’t change a lot. If you don’t currently play Minecraft, Paxterya will stay exactly the way it is now for you. We absolutely will keep our Discord server around till the end of time. Because this community that has originally grown around Minecraft is still thriving – just discussing other topics. When our Minecraft server shuts down, you might see some new arrangements of the channels, but the people will still be the same. Let's stay in touch and meet for game nights occasionally!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor those of you who are still very much playing Minecraft and enjoying every second of it: We’re sorry to leave you hanging like this. But we’re sure you will find another server that’s more active, more motivated, and more fun to play on. You do deserve a blocky environment where everyone involved is passionately playing Minecraft, including the owners. We’d however be delighted if you sticked around to still be part of this non-Minecraft-playing community!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you’ll be playing Minecraft on another server – or even if you’re going to make your own – we encourage you to share where you’re going in \u003Cb\u003E#smp-radar\u003C\u002Fb\u003E. You don’t have to do this, but it would be an easy way for you to form groups and still play together on other servers. You can advertise other SMPs in that channel and discuss your experiences there. Just please keep it personal and don't spam ad messages there.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWrapping Up\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to each and every one of you to have been part of this Minecraft journey.

The blocky sandbox game has risen from a one-man project by a then unknown developer to the single best-selling video game in history, owned by one of the largest tech companies in the world. It has influenced an entire generation of gamers, practically everybody has played it at some point in their life, and the streak of success seems to continue forever. How did it get there? How does Mojang keep Minecraft alive? And when will the era of Minecraft come to an end?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube-nocookie.com\u002Fembed\u002FAu_RDBi3KM0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe beginnings of Minecraft\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn May 2009, nobody has yet heard of Minecraft. That's because the Swedish game developer Markus Persson, better known as Notch, first named his project &ldquo;Cave Game&rdquo;. Shortly after, he renamed it to &ldquo;Minecraft: The Order of the Stone&rdquo;, then to just &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo;. He probably didn't guess he was working on what was soon to become a phenomenal hit. Fast forward by 5 years (November 2014), and he sells his game to Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars. He has since largely disappeared from public interest, but Minecraft has only kept growing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, Minecraft's long lasting success is partly due to it being a sandbox game. It gives you no instructions on where to go and what to do, and so there's no clear end to the gameplay. The so-called &ldquo;End&rdquo; in-game is really just a new world that opens even more possibilities, so the gameplay experience in Minecraft is what the player makes of it. Everyone can follow their passions and so entire subcultures developed inside of Minecraft. There's people interested in building, redstone, PVP, modding, texture pack and skin creation... You know the drill. Compared to some other popular games, Minecraft offers the most individualized gameplay, and the highest replay value. You can always start a new world and create new things, as long as you have fresh ideas. So the very concept of Minecraft is part of its long-term success, binding players to the game for more than 12 years now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe update philosophy\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important factor in the continuous success of Minecraft is the way Mojang updates their game. When you look at the list of the best-selling video games in the world, most of them were released to the public at one point and then never have been changed in any major way. Minecraft is different, and that's part of why it's on the top of that list.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the last 10 years, Mojang has released 18 major updates, on average a new update with new, game-changing features every 7 months. This constant addition of new content surely helps to spark the players' creativity. And that creativity is what Minecraft relies on to keep players engaged.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngagement is a key word in Mojang's philosophy. Before any update, they hear out the community &ndash; the best example being the votes on new features during Minecon. In 2019, players could vote which of three biomes should be redesigned, and a year later they could choose which new mob was to be added to the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot only does this prevent any big backlash about unpopular changes, because people had a choice, but it makes sure there are no unpopular changes in the first place. This is of course highly subjective, but generally, the new features in all the major updates have been received relatively well by the player base. That's because Mojang succeeds to keep everything coherent &ndash; or &ldquo;minecraft-y&rdquo;. The new features don't seem out of place, they fit into the existing environment. So how do they achieve that? Do the Mojang devs just have a great intuition about what is too far away from the Minecraft feeling? Well, probably also that, but what really matters here is the way Mojang constantly asks for community feedback. There are lots of tweets you can find where normal players directly influenced the development process, because many Minecraft developers are very active on Twitter and engage with the community.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo after 12 years of constant changes to the game, the only instance of widespread criticism of a new update is when Mojang changed the PVP system in 2016. Not a bad record.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother great example of Mojang's dedication to keep the game &ldquo;minecraft-y&rdquo; is how they handled the new &ldquo;archaeology&rdquo; feature. After it had been announced to be released in 1.17, then 1.18, it has been postponed to an undisclosed date because Mojang felt it didn't yet fit in the Vanilla Minecraft world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMinecraft Multiplayer: Games In The Game\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArguably the most important Minecraft update was the multiplayer update in August 2010. It was part of an early alpha version, which goes to show that multiplayer is at the very core of Minecraft. Now while it was originally intended for playing Survival Minecraft with your friends instead of alone, this new feature was the stepping stone to much more than that. Thanks to multiplayer, entire games have been made inside of Minecraft, resulting in hugely successful server networks offering dozens of game modes to players. So you could argue that by buying Minecraft, you don't just buy one, but potentially hundreds of games. In this regard, Mojang hugely profits from its player base's creativity. With Minecraft, they give the creative outlet to players, developers and modders to come up with new things themselves, contributing to Minecraft's overall popularity and success.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECommunities and subcultures\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith all the creative tools Minecraft has to offer, thousands of communities have evolved around the game. There are countless Minecraft servers, Discord servers, forums, subreddits and so on about different aspects of Minecraft. People form small and large groups around their shared passion, find friends, inspire each other, and with joined forces, they often create stunning work. If you take it to the extreme, you could even compare Minecraft to social media. It arguably connects people in a more profound way than Facebook ever has.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what does Mojang do to promote this? Today, apart from making the game, they also offer basic server hosting for groups of friends to play together. In 2013, Mojang introduced Minecraft Realms which enables you to very easily rent a server directly from the in-game menu. Where you had to consult an external service provider before, Mojang now got you covered. Definitely part of a bigger strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ELet's Play Minecraft\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there's YouTube. Minecraft is huge on YouTube. In the early days of Let's Play videos, there was still uncertainty about copyright issues, whether players were actually allowed to upload content entirely recorded in-game. But eventually the consensus was that game studios profit from these free advertisements of their games. Minecraft soon became the biggest Let's Play category on YouTube, as Mojang actively encouraged players to create Minecraft content. During Minecon 2013 for instance, there were panels about different aspects of content creation, teaching players how to build an audience and essentially generate more public interest for Minecraft. A win-win situation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMore Diversity: Reaching New Audiences\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Minecraft is everywhere. The game has become a brand, there's Minecraft t-shirts, mugs, keychains, books, lamps, phone cases, pins, and of course the spin-off games Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, Minecraft Story Mode and there's even a Minecraft Education Edition.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd, more importantly, the original Minecraft game has been renamed to &ldquo;Minecraft Java Edition&rdquo;, and the original logo now belongs to the cross-platform Bedrock Edition. The Bedrock edition was Mojang's attempt to acquire new players with improved performance on the PC, but also enabling users of other devices to play Minecraft on phones and tablets, on the XBOX, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and even in VR. While the Bedrock Edition has long lacked popularity among many veteran Java Edition players, Mojang's strategy fully worked out. The monthly sales of Bedrock edition have long surpassed those of the Java Edition. Part of its financial success is the marketplace where you can buy skins, maps, texture packs, or, well: things you can get for free on Java Edition. One of the reasons many Java players dislike the Bedrock edition.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, Mojang found a way to keep making money off of a game that most people already bought &ndash; and in the end, all Minecraft players profit from that, as the development continues.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe Future: When Will Minecraft End?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past years, Mojang constantly added more blocks, items and features to their game &ndash; making the gameplay more varied, more interesting, but also &ndash; more complex. Today, Minecraft has 3 dimensions, 75 mobs, 79 biomes and a staggering 726 different items. That's twice the amount of items there were in 2011. Can this trend continue forever? Inventory management has become a real issue for many players, and Mojang has not yet come up with a viable solution.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat's for sure is that the gameplay can still become much more complex and still be playable. Dozens of very popular modpacks out there prove that. The decision from what point on the number of features becomes too overwhelming for the average person and especially new players is ultimately up to Mojang. But given their history of hearing the community's feedback, I'm sure they will make the right decision. Today, there is still no end in sight for the development of Minecraft, and whether a final Minecraft version will ever be released is up for the future to show us. Until then, let's look forward to the biggest Minecraft update in a long time, 1.18. And celebrate this game that makes you keep coming back like no other.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",date:{$date:"2021-06-25T00:00:00Z"},public:b,title:"How Mojang Keeps Minecraft Alive",__v:a},{_id:{$oid:"60c1ccfbb2687c0011868ea1"},id:27,author:c,body:"\u003Cp\u003EMinecraft 1.17 is now finally released, and the start of Season 5 comes ever closer!

As a processor it is running an Intel Core i7 6700, which is now four generations old, but was pretty top of the line in terms of gaming performance when it launched back in 2015.\n          For Memory we have 64GB of DDR4 RAM, which is more than plentiful for running \"only\" a Minecraft server.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Storage is also relatively important, but our two 512GB NVME SSDs are plenty fast on paper, although they seemed to have some problems and showed signs of aging. Most servers use multiple storage devices together in a RAID. This just means that you can pool storage devices together, in our case with a RAID 1 one drive could have died and you wouldn't even have noticed it. On the downside this also costs one drive worth of storage that you cannot use.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          In summary, this was a fine server for its price, but big farms, tons of villagers and a lot of sheep in the spawn chunks demanded some more potent hardware. I also had to get creative to reduce the storage needs of our dynmap (at some point it used 200GB of storage).\n          \u003Cbr\u003E\n          We also had two more so-called \"cloud\" servers. These are small virtualized servers running on a bigger one. This allows a hosting company to split a single powerful server into many smaller slices that they can sell for a much cheaper prize.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Our website and Discord bot ran on one of these and all the performance monitoring ran on the other one.\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Ch3\u003ELessons learned\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E\n          It is always important to reflect what you have done and look at the past to find things you have done wrong or not optimally. I don't think that anything about the hardware choices is wrong, we just outgrew it, which is natural and a good thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Well that leaves the software side. We had one fairly powerful server, yet we also rented two more cloud servers for seemingly no real reason. Was the main dedicated server to weak? No. Would anyone have noticed any slowdown if everything would have been centralized? No.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Why did you do it that way then? Well, running a lot of different software pieces together like that poses a handful of challenges:\u003Cbr\u003E\n          First of all there is the security and stability angle. You don't want software A to access the files of software B. Say, software A has a newly discovered security vulnerability that allows random hackers to access files that software A has access to. If everything is shielded off, that's unfortunate but not a problem of \"nuclear\" scale. The same problem can also be caused by bugs and so on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          The second thing to consider is performance. Databases in particular are known for using a lot of RAM for things like caching. That means that the database doesn't need to read everything from the slower disks all the time, instead they can get their data from the much faster memory. This is all fine and good until you need to run multiple different databases that take all of the systems memory hostage for their caching needs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          The third reason also has its place, but hasn't been an issue for us yet. Its dependencies. Let's say software A needs software C installed to function. software B also needs software C. All fine and good, until A and B need different versions of C. But C doesn't like to be installed twice...\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Good solutions to these problems (and I probably forgot a few more) exist and I will discuss our new approach in the \"New software\" section. Limited knowledge on my part meant that the best solution to me was just running three servers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          You might ask what the problem with running three servers instead of one is. The answer is simple: Work. Say there is a new vulnerability in sshd (the piece of software that let's me connect and manage the servers remotely) and I want to apply the software update. With three servers I have to do the process three times, with one server it only needs to be done once. This is obviously one example of many. Another might be the amount of passwords to \"remember\".\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Ch3\u003ENew hardware\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E\n          Okay, now let's finally leave the boring past behind us and talk about the new hardware. For the processor we went with a system equipped with an AMD Ryzen 3900. It not only has three times as many cores as our old i7, it also has more performance per core. The singlecore performance bump is what will hopefully help Minecraft to run faster. The tripling of cores is what is going to allow us to run multiple server simultaneously (like our new creative server).\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Memory was plenty even on our old server, but our new one comes with a sweet doubling to 128GB. That much memory has a nice advantage tho: Caching. I talked about caching of databases earlier, turns out linux (the only real server operating system ;) ) also does caching for everything stored on disk. So, having enough memory will help with stuff like restart and save times of gameservers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Our storage is probably the biggest increase. It is almost four times as large with two 1.92TB of (again) blazing fast NVME SSDs. We can only use 1.92TB because of RAID. But that means that one SSD could die and the only one who would notice it is me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          We also still have one cloud server because that was just the easiest route to get our new gameserver hosting software going. More on that in the following section.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          All in all, we made a pretty solid deal. Paying about twice as much for 3x the CPU cores, 2x the memory and 4x the storage capacity.\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Ch3\u003ENew software\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E\n          The \"Lesson learned\" section goes into a lot of detail about separating software for various benefits. Now let's talk about the solution.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Well not so easy. There are actually two solutions, one older one and one that's fairly new. The old one is called virtual machine. These virtual machines date back into the late 60s and are described by wikipedia as the following: \"In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer.\".\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Okay great, but what does that mean? Well a virtual machine is basically a program running on a physical computer or server. Inside of that \"program\" there are one or multiple fully operational operating systems. All the hardware of a VM doesn't \u003Ci\u003Eactually\u003C\u002Fi\u003E exist. It is all running in software. Each network adapter, every storage disk. Nothing is real. Well of course there are many optimizations, code and programs that run inside the VM can actually be executed directly by the processor without any kind of translation and memory is also directly accessed, yet separated between VMs and the physical host system. You might see some virtualization related options in your computers BIOS settings, these allow various things like enabling direct hardware access, while keeping everything nice and separated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          That separation is why VMs are great and still widely used today. Every VM running on the physical host runs its own full operating system (including the kernel, the bit of code closest to hardware in an operating system). This carries a huge benefit: Using different operating systems on one physical computer\u002Fserver. This allows you to try out linux or even macOS on your windows PC without needing to worry about loosing any data. The strong separation also allows you try out viruses inside a VM without it effecting anything else (you still need to be careful that there is absolutely no connection like networking!!).\u003Cbr\u003E\n          If it sounds to you like that's a massive amount of overhead for when you don't actually need that strong separation, then well, you're absolutely right. The overhead isn't that huge, but it can be a lot of work to manage multiple VMs, when you could have used something leaner instead.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          That leaner technology has many names: Containers is probably a good one. Many people also refer to it as \"Docker \u002F Docker containers\" tho, because that's the specific piece of extra software that made containers as popular as they are today.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Containers are enabled by a future in the linux kernel (only one of many reasons why linux is awesome) called namespaces. What that means is, that, all running containers and the host use the same kernel. All software running in containers is then separated off just by the fact that it is in a different namespace with limited access to processes running in other namespaces. Containers also only have very limited access to the filesystem of the host.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          This eliminates overhead caused by virtualization. The real advantage and power of containers lies in more modern principles. Containers should be stateless, that means that they should not contain any data. Data should be stored in special volumes that can outlife a container, in a database or directly on the host filesystem. This allows you to delete and rebuild a container without losing any data.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Installing new software is as easy as copying the contents of a special \u003Ci\u003Edocker-compose.yml\u003C\u002Fi\u003E file to your host, modifying a few bits to suit your needs and then running the command \u003Ci\u003Edocker-compose up -d\u003C\u002Fi\u003E is all you need to do. After leaning back for a short bit while docker downloads everything you are left with a new application running. This application can consist of multiple containers, volumes, shared network ports, private networks for the containers to communicate with each other and so much more. Meanwhile in the old days you would have needed to install the operating system, dependencies, the software itself and then configure all the dependencies so they work with the software you actually want to use.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Okay so, containers are great, but do you know what's even greater? Images! Well not the kind of images you take with your phone. I mean the images that represent the \"hard disk\" storing all the software components of a container. In fact, a container is just the running state of an image. Images in docker are simply amazing, because they have \u003Ci\u003Elayers\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. Your first layer might be a distro of linux, like alpine which is specifically made for running in containers. The second one could contain all the dependencies you need and the third the actually application you want to run. Now when updating your application, the layers of the OS and dependencies can stay the same. When you then want to deploy the new image on your server, you only need to download and store the new application layer. When you create a container based on an image, a new layer gets created that contains all the changes the container makes when running (like writing log files).\u003Cbr\u003E\n          I could probably fill many more overly long blog posts with talk about containers and docker, but I will stop now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n          We went down the docker path for our server. As of right now we are running seven containers, these are databases, monitoring tools, the creative Minecraft server (and soon the SMP) and also our website.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          For this to work I had to create my own docker image for the website\u002Fdiscord-bot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          As a programmer you write code. Storing that code only on your computer in plain files is a horrible idea, because what do you do when you want to share your code with others, and, even worse: What happens when others have changes for you? How do you incorporate these into the codebase? What do you do when you also changed some of the same parts of the code? You cry. And then you start using git. Git is a protocol that allows you to store code on a central server, every developer can then check out code, work on it locally and, when done, push the changes back to the central server. To make it easier there is a neat feature called branches. Different branches don't affect each other. So you could implement new features in one branch that might break stuff short-term, while fixing important bugs in your main branch. When you're done implementing the feature, you can just merge the changes back into the master branch. While doing that you might have to resolve some merge conflicts, when different changes from both branches collide. You could just run a git server yourself, but there are some code-collaboration platforms that are build ontop of git and have more features like issue tracking. One of these is Github and we did use that for almost a year before switching to Gitlab a few weeks ago. I really love Gitlab so far as it has some more features than Github (like a darkmode!).\u003Cbr\u003E\n          One of the things that Gitlab is pretty good at is doing things with your code automatically (called CI\u002FCD). Github now also has expanded in that regard, but whatever. Why am I telling you all this? Well, I had the challenge of needing to build my own docker image and I just wanted to brag how easily I did that with Gitlab. Now every time I push code to the main \"master\" branch, Gitlab automagically builds a new image based on a \u003Ci\u003EDockerfile\u003C\u002Fi\u003E that's also part of the codebase. The Dockerfile just gives build instructions, like which files should be put where, which commands need to be run to install all necessary stuff, etc. No more than five minutes after I pushed code to master, I can pull the changes on the server to update the image, send another command to rebuild the running container and then everything is up-to-date. I can even see the status of the image build right inside of my programming tool (IDE) Visual Studio Code.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Okay I think this section is already waaaay to looooong, so imma make the last thing quick (I promise).\u003Cbr\u003E\n          That would be the software to run the Minecraft server(s). Sure, I could just use some Minecraft server container and call it a day, but that's hard to manage. In the past we used multicraft, which you might have used already when renting a Minecraft server at ceratin hosting companies. Multicraft is nice, but basically not possible to run inside a container. Well, it is possible, but then all Minecraft servers would run inside of a single container, which is not ideal. Instead I chose to go for Pterodactyl, which not only looks more modern, but it also has a better feature set enabling you to do more things like limiting memory, CPU usage, storage space and even prioritize storage access for some containers. Pterodactyl also goes beyond just running Minecraft servers. The list of supported games is long and growing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Now I will stop with this section, when you want to know more about what Pterodactyl can do, just hit me up on Discord and I will write a follow up in the future, when I gained more experience.\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Ch3\u003EThe future\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E\n          An outlook into the future is also fun.

Please read everything carefully and then tell us what you think over in #paxterya!\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Okay, but now let's get this train going!\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Ch3\u003E(Public) Farms\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E  \n          This is a difficult one as there two kinds of players: Communists and Capitalists. \u003Ci\u003EWell also a few that don't care.\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Now it's our job to strike a balance between both playstyles. The problem with having public farms is that they completely destroy the experience of players that like building farms \u003Cb\u003Eand\u003C\u002Fb\u003E selling their items.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          We think that we found a good middle-ground by having a list of farm types that are allowed to be public and free:\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n          \u003Cul class=\"rules\"\u003E\n            \u003Cli\u003EXP farms of any kind\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n            \u003Cli\u003EVillager trading halls\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n            \u003Cli\u003EIron farms\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n            \u003Cli\u003E(Cobble)stone farms\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n            \u003Cli\u003EWool farms\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n            \u003Cli\u003EManual mostly decorative farms (like the public field in TOP)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n            \u003Cli\u003EGravity duper\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n          \u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E \n          Just because a farm is on this list does \u003Cb\u003Enot\u003C\u002Fb\u003E mean that all farms of the type need to be free to access and use for all players.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Also all public farms need to be approved through the moderators and admins. The goal is to better coordinate and plan building these public farms, so we can ensure optimal location, efficiency and performance optimization.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          This would be beneficial for performance reasons as we can hopefully reduce the number of these farms on the server. Especially villager trading halls are slowing the server down quite significantly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Farms that are not on the list need to be operated either completely privately (Only use the items for yourself) or the items need to be sold for valuables (like diamonds). Massively undercutting prices of competitors is not allowed. Staff will decide what these boundaries exactly are on a case-by-case basis. Small gifts and random acts of kindness are obviously also allowed (like gifting a new player a few rockets). Just be responsible and don't destroy the fun (and profits) of other farm owners. \n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Ch3\u003ETowns\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E  \n          First up: If you are currently a mayor, then you will need to reapply, as no towns are going to carry over automatically.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Towns are pretty central to the experience on Paxterya and we only want to improve on that front. Towns are great as they cluster players together and produce more cooperation, which is great for the community feeling. That's why we want to reduce the overall amount of towns to boost larger towns.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          To do that, we are now going to enforce the 5 citizen minimum when founding a new town. This newish threshold also applies to currently still existing towns. We hope that this will result in larger towns, like Paxterdam which is pretty huge.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Not all players are motivated to stay on Paxterya for many months at a time, so we end up with inactive players. Every couple of months we mark players that haven't played in a month inactive. That already affected mayors, which raised the question of what should happen to their towns.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Introducing: Ghost towns! A town will be declared a ghost town when it has no active citizens anymore. A ghost town will remain visible on dynmap, but it will be forbidden to build in them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          To keep track of citizenship, we are going to utilize Discord roles for now. We are planning to integrate that into our member-only interface in the future, but for now this simple solution will do just fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          This means that you will need to tell a mod or admin when you change citizenship. For now I think a limit of two towns you can join as a citizen should be decent.\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Ch3\u003EDatapacks & Plugins\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E\n          On the plugin side there won't be any change for now. This means we will keep using CoreProtect, DiscordSRV, Dynmap, Worldborder (Set to 20kx20k blocks for the start, but expanding over time) and of course our own PaxteryaPlugin (terrible name I know).\u003Cbr\u003E\n          In terms of datapacks we will change things a bit around. We plan to use silence mobs, durability ping, custom armor stands, multiplayer sleep, coordinate HUD and last, but not least nether portal coordinates. Most of them are already on the server, but broken. I hope that I can get them all working now tho.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          We had a bit of a difficult time with datapacks that modify vanilla crafting recipes. There is one that sounds very useful as it allows you to craft some things, that would normally require a crafting table, in your inventory. We are unsure if this is a good thing to add, so we made a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.strawpoll.me\u002F20540153\"\u003Estrawpoll\u003C\u002Fa\u003E where you can voice your opinion.\n        \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n        \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n        \u003Cp\u003E\n          I think that was everything we wanted to discuss for now. Again, if you have any opinions on our proposed changes, then please discuss with us in the #paxterya channel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n          Another blogpost detailing our new hardware and server setup will come online tomorrow!

And also it’s a moderators job to Watch chat carefully at all times and be active and chat (including wanting to help players). but be kind and if anything happens mildly bad in chat, tell people to calm down and try to even out the situation. But also it’s a moderators job to report any foul things going on that they have no power to fix, to you or exxplore ASAP so that you guys can fix\u002Fcorrect the problem.   Also I think it’s a main moderators job to be friendly and welcoming and helpful to all on the server no matter what and to hold no grudges even if another player hates you. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\nI am in the Pacific Time zone on the west coast of the USA and I’m reachable at all times no matter what , 24\u002F7\u002F365 (which means that I am even on *sometimes when the Europeans are asleep) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\nAnything else I want to say?  well hmm... I think that you guys are awesome and doing a great job of running the server.  I really like this server so far and I hope that I am able to fill the position of moderator for you because I promise you that if I do get to help you, I promise I won’t let you down. My main goal is to prove to you guys into the community that I am honest and trustworthy and can be kind and fair and I do want to help— both ways still if I’m am allowed to help as a moderator— But even if Not, so that perhaps one day I might be able to.  I hope this makes sense.  Regardless I like it here and I plan on staying for a while— as long as I’m allowed to\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\nI almost forgot to say just one last thing... sorry.  I’m glad you like the application and I hope that it’s OK and acceptable, to your favour\u002Fliking and that I meet Almost all, if not all, of the qualifications.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\nsorry for the application being so long. Though the one thing that I wanted to say in closing—- I definitely agree that a moderators position should be also with reporting stuff to you guys (within my capacity), giving verbal warnings in chat where needed sometimes, timeouts if needed, and also bans but only if absolutely necessary for Repeat offenders who have already been warned or given time outs or been kicked. But never abusing the power— ever— because doing that would be a complete betrayal of trust and compromise of position On the server as a moderator and within the community, not just to you and exxplore but to everybody else.\nNot to mention that would show that if one were abusing Power as a moderator that they do not know how to do their job correctly or efficiently and should be removed from said position effective immediately after, as well as giving a verbal warning (if not being banned). though that fate would then be up to the server admins.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\nAlso it’s a moderators job to be in cohesiveness and oneness not just with the community but with the fellow moderators and admins, Transparent in everything... but communicating often and openly with one another. So that if the situation comes up the story can be corroborated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\nSay for example — a player is starting arguments and chat and the argument gets handled by an moderator or admin if another one is present (or even a player) then they can back up that others person’s story, Whether it be of the player or the witnessing\u002Fhandling moderator.... Though it would probably normally be between moderators\u002Fadmins because if left to a player could get kind of confusing. If this makes sense?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\nanyway that’s pretty much all I had to say is that I agree about being able to do what needs to be done I want to situation by situation basis as necessary.\nThat’s all I guess.

With respect to how the actual moderator should behave, effectively like every other player (\u002Ftp only in emergency, no use of the \u002Fgive command, etc.).
