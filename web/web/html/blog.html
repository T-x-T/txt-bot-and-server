      <p>Another week has passed in the lands of Paxterya and lots of cool new things are to be discovered! Not only have we updated to <b>Minecraft version 1.15</b>, but many beautiful buildings have been added to the world as well!</p>

      <h3>The Town of Paxterya: A new Mayor!</h3>
      <div class="article-img big">

        <span class="subtitle">The paxteryan Town Hall</span>
      </div>
      <p>The people had a choice: The old mayor TxT held its promise by organising a mayor election. TxT himself however did not candidate. But jadesheep and Veikmaster did! And the winner wasâ€¦ both of them! The candidates not being very competetive and the citizens approving, it just so happened that the Town of Paxterya now has a government of two people! We're looking forward to seeing the town prosper under our new leaders.<br>
Their task will be to organize the town: new citizen must be registered, people ought to pay taxes to finance public infrastructure, and finally the aesthetics of the town must be managed, too. Lots of important tasks we shall be grateful for for being in competent hands! </p>

      <h3>The first member-founded town: Penliam</h3>
      <p>Not only have there been major developments in the Town of Paxterya, as there now is another town in our world! Penliam, with its mayor ChryoFyre, is located a kilometer south-west of the Town of Paxterya and thus outside the snowy tundra. As every town gets an area on the map that they exclusively control, Penliam can easily be found on our Dynmap, too. It seems to be medieval-themed as well and it's definitely worth a visit! The Town of Paxterya wishes Penliam good progress and hopes to build trustful trade relations one day!</p>

      <h3>The demise of the Ender Dragon</h3>
      <p>In a swift and effective order-to-kill mission which lasted no longer than 10 minutes, an ensemble of blood-thirsty warriors took on the fight with the Ender Dragon. The latter stood no chance and was crushed before he even fully realized what was going on.<br>
The End is now conquered, but our journey has only just begun!</p>

    <h2>Paxterya Recap #1: A Beautiful Start</h2>

      <p>Paxterya Beta 2 has been online for one week now and lots of cool things happened. In the Paxterya Recap series, we want to regularly give you some insight into what is happening on the server. So let's get into it!</p>

        <span class="subtitle">The center of the Town of Paxterya</span>
      </div>

      <p>After the slight surprise at the beginning that the spawn is in a snow biome, the first few settlers started to like the idea of a cozy wooden hut in a wintry environment, now that Christmas is nearing. So they founded a town in the midst of the crisp-cold area.</p>

      <div class="article-img big">

        <span class="subtitle">The Town center from South</span>
      </div>

      <h3>The Town of Paxterya</h3>
      <p>The first town, at the center of the world, is currently run by its mayor TxT. He promised elections though, so if you want to have a say, become a town citizen by simply building a (medieval-themed) house there! We're happy to see that a handful of people already moved to our prospering town and contributed neat houses! If you're not yet living in the Town of Paxterya, we suggest you do it soon as long as there are good spots left!</p>

      <h3>Your own Town</h3>
      <p>In case you don't like the medieval theme, why not found your very own town with its own theme? As soon as you have three houses from three different people in an area, the Town of Paxterya will recognize your status and be looking forward to building a diplomatic relation!</p>

    <h2>Paxterya Beta 2 Now Up and Running!</h2>

      <p>Today was the (semi)big day! We've made another milestone towards Paxterya's big launch: Paxterya Beta 2 was opened!<br>
        If all those Paxteryas and launches got you confused, here's a quick overview:</p>

      <h3>June 3rd, 2017</h3>
      <p>An SMP launched. Historians refer to it as "The Original Paxterya". After its downfall, there was a long period of nothingness. Until it was agreed upon to revive this glorious name.</p>

      <h3>September 23rd, 2019</h3>
      <p>Paxterya Beta launched. Just an ordinary SMP where members needed to apply in a Discord channel. Oldschool! Died out after a few months, the players not knowing what to build next. Classic Minecraft problem we try to approach with Paxterya's ongoing development!</p>

      <h3>December 1st, 2019</h3>
      <p>Paxterya Beta 2 launched. New world, new motivation, new ideas, and also: new website! The applications are no longer done in public forums, but via our application form! Your chance to <a href="https://paxterya.com/join-us">join the community</a> and lay the foundation for the future!</p>

      <h3>What's next?</h3>
      <p>At some point in the future, Paxterya will be sophisticated enough for us to remove the Beta from its name. Until then, let's build another unique world in our favorite game of all!</p>

    <h2>Hello World! This Is Paxterya Under Construction!</h2>
    <img class="author" src="assets/paxterya/img/avatar-exxplore.png">

      <p>Welcome on the brand new website of Paxterya, a soon-to-be Vanilla Minecraft server! Minecraft has been revived lately and we don't want to miss out on that. We, that is TxT and ExxPlore, are the admins of Paxterya. A while ago, we already hosted a Minecraft survival server which was tons of fun. But this time it's going to be even better! We present to you the basic concept of Paxterya:</p>

      <h3>Vanilla Survival</h3>
      <p>On Paxterya, you get the full Vanilla Minecraft experience. You start from scratch like in Singleplayer, but with the advantage of a welcoming community around you!</p>

      <div class="article-img">
        <img src="https://play.paxterya.com/assets/website/article_1/img.jpg">
        <span class="subtitle">The Spawn Hub on Paxterya</span>
      </div>

      <h3>Build a Town</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to build a medieval themed town around the spawn of the map. If you are not a fan of this building style or if you would rather live on your own, then you can also explore the world and set your own base up.</p>

      <h3>Be Independent</h3>
      <p>If you don't choose to build in the spawn area, you can go rural and build in whatever style you like outside of our town! Our world has no limits besides the sky! You could even create your own cities and communities or build huge farms.

        <h3>Vanilla-ish Survival?</h3>
        <p>Well, when we say Vanilla we mean that your experience is just like in Vanilla singleplayer, with some modifications to make playing together smoother. This includes a plugin with which only half the players need to sleep, <a href="https://play.paxterya.com/dynmap">Dynmap</a>, so you can view Paxterya's map wherever you go, and last but not least a plugin that helps us figuring out who burned your home down. If so.</p>

        <h3>Sounds good?</h3>
        <p>Did this quick overview make you feel like joining? Paxterya is going to launch on <b>December 1st, 2019</b>, but you can already <b><a href="https://discord.gg/mAjZCTG">join our Discord server</a></b> and <b><a href="join-us.html">apply</a></b>! See you soon!</p>
