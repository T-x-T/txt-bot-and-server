            <p>The Farming Map exists to keep the Vanilla Map as tidy as possible. If for example you don't like to build a huge mob farm right next to your neat hut in the woods, the Farming Map is the place to go. It's got large biomes, so there's plenty of space for your industrial farms. Of course it's not forbidden to build your residence here. The neighbouring factories just might make some noise.<br>
            You can build-protect your constructions in this world, too.<br>
            To get to the Farming Map, type <b>/warp farming</b> in the in-game chat.
