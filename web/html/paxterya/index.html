                <section>
                    <p>Welcome on the brand new website of Paxterya, a soon-to-be Vanilla Minecraft server! Minecraft has been revived lately and we don't want to miss out on that. We, that is <a href="our-team.html">TxT and ExxPlore</a>, the admins of Paxterya. A while ago, we already hosted a Minecraft survival server which was tons of fun. But this time it's going to be even better! We present to you the basic concept of Paxterya:</p>

                    <h3>Vanilla Survival</h3>
                    <p>On Paxterya, you get the full Vanilla Minecraft experience. You start from scratch like in Singleplayer, but with the advantage of a welcoming community around you!</p>

                    <div class="article-img">

                        <span class="subtitle">The Spawn Hub on Paxterya</span>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Build a Town</h3>
                    <p>The spawn area (500x500 blocks around the spawn) is build-protected, but you can get a plot to build your home near the center, it's free real estate! Note that in the spawn area, you can only build houses that match its medieval style. Learn more about <a href="#">building in the spawn area.</a></p>

                    <h3>Be Independent</h3>
                    <p>If you don't choose to build in the spawn area, you can go rural and build in whatever style you like outside of the build-protected zone! Our world has no limits besides the sky! To protect your buildings from other players, read the <a href="#">guide about build protection</a>.

                    <h3>Discover New Lands</h3>
                    <p>Apart from the normal Vanilla overworld, there is another realm on Paxterya. The custom terrain map with astonishing landscapes is the perfect environment for your most beautiful builds! To keep it beautiful, you can protect your plot, too.</p>

                    <h3>Sounds good?</h3>
                    <p>Did this quick overview make you feel like joining? Paxterya is going to launch on <b>[DATE]</b>, but you can already <b><a href="#">join our Discord server!</a></b> There, we will notify you when the applications are open. See you soon!</p>
