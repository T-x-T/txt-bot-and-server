                        <li>It is forbidden to steal items from unprotected chests (<a href="#"><b>learn how to protect your chests</b></a>). This counts for chests on mob farms etc, too; ask the farm's owner first.</li>

                        <li>It is forbidden to kill, free or steal other player's animals or villagers.</li>
